- Read from text file 
- Create two lists with each column of numbers
- Sort both lists in ascending order (O(logn): tim sort)
- Loop and compare each number at the same index (O(n))
- Accumulate sum for total distances

- Create a map with the right column (column2)
    - Key: integer
    - Value: count
- Initialize a similarity score
- For each number in the left column (column1) multiply by it's respective value in the map of column2
- Add each score to the similarity score
- Return final similarity score
